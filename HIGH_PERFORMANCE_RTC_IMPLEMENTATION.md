# High Performance RTC Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the technical architecture and implementation guidelines for building a high-performance Real-Time Communication (RTC) system using our state machine library. The architecture is designed to handle enterprise-scale telecom workloads with FreeSWITCH ESL integration.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### State Machine Library Status
- ✅ **Custom `GenericStateMachine`**: Already optimized for telecom use cases
- ✅ **StateMachineRegistry**: Well-designed for concurrent call management
- ✅ **No external dependencies**: Pure custom implementation
- ✅ **ESL Event Processing**: Ready for FreeSWITCH integration

### Performance Characteristics
- **Current Throughput**: ~5,000-10,000 events/second
- **Target Throughput**: 50,000+ events/second
- **Concurrent Calls**: Currently limited by threading model
- **Target Concurrent Calls**: 50,000+ simultaneous calls

## Recommended Architecture

### Core Concurrency Model

#### 1. ESL Event Processing: Event Loop (Single Thread)
**Why Event Loop for ESL:**
- ESL events are inherently asynchronous and non-blocking
- FreeSWITCH generates pure reactive event streams
- No blocking operations needed for event processing
- Natural fit for event-driven architecture

**Performance Targets:**
- 50,000+ ESL events/second on single thread
- Sub-millisecond event processing latency
- Minimal memory overhead per event
- Predictable, consistent performance

#### 2. Business Logic Processing: Virtual Threads (Java 21+)
**Why Virtual Threads for Business Logic:**
- Business operations involve blocking I/O (database, external APIs)
- Partner identification, authentication, balance checks require external calls
- Natural blocking code style maintains readability
- Excellent scalability with minimal resource usage

**Performance Targets:**
- 100,000+ concurrent business operations
- Natural blocking programming model
- <few KB memory per virtual thread
- Standard debugging and error handling

## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Threading Strategy

#### ESL Event Processing
- **Single dedicated thread** for all ESL event processing
- **Non-blocking queue** for event buffering during bursts
- **Event-to-StateMachine mapping** via CallID
- **Direct state machine event firing** on ESL thread

#### Business Logic Operations
- **Virtual thread per business operation** (auth, rating, etc.)
- **Async/await pattern** for external service calls
- **Timeout management** for all external operations
- **Circuit breaker pattern** for fault tolerance

#### State Machine Management
- **Synchronous event processing** within state machines
- **Asynchronous business logic triggering** on state entry
- **Thread-safe state transitions** using atomic operations
- **Automatic cleanup** of completed call state machines

### 2. Performance Optimizations

#### Memory Management
- **Object pooling** for frequently created event objects
- **Off-heap storage** for massive call volumes (Chronicle Map)
- **Lock-free data structures** where possible
- **Minimal object allocation** in hot paths

#### CPU Optimization
- **Single-threaded ESL processing** eliminates context switching
- **Cache-friendly data structures** for better CPU utilization
- **Batch processing** for database operations
- **JIT-friendly code patterns** for hotspot optimization

#### Network I/O
- **Async database drivers** for non-blocking persistence
- **Connection pooling** for external service calls
- **Binary serialization** for high-throughput scenarios
- **Keep-alive connections** to external services

### 3. Fault Tolerance

#### Circuit Breakers
- **Partner Service**: 50% failure rate threshold, 30s recovery
- **Balance Service**: 30% failure rate threshold, 10s recovery
- **Rating Service**: 40% failure rate threshold, 20s recovery
- **Routing Service**: 60% failure rate threshold, 15s recovery

#### Timeout Management
- **Partner Identification**: 5 seconds
- **Authentication**: 3 seconds
- **Balance Check/Reserve**: 2 seconds
- **Call Rating**: 2 seconds
- **Route Finding**: 3 seconds
- **Call Setup**: 60 seconds

#### Graceful Degradation
- **Cached partner data** for service outages
- **Default routing** when routing service fails
- **Emergency balance checks** for critical customers
- **Call admission control** during system stress

### 4. State Machine Business Logic Integration

#### Call Flow States
1. **CREATED** → ESL CHANNEL_CREATE received
2. **PARTNER_IDENTIFICATION** → Identify calling partner by source IP
3. **AUTHENTICATION** → Authenticate caller credentials
4. **BALANCE_CHECK** → Check and reserve customer balance
5. **RATING** → Calculate call costs and rates
6. **ROUTING** → Find optimal route for destination
7. **PARKED** → Call parked in FreeSWITCH waiting for connection
8. **CONNECTING** → Attempting to establish call
9. **CONNECTED** → Call in progress, billing active
10. **COMPLETED** → Call ended, cleanup and CDR generation

#### Business Logic Services
- **PartnerService**: IP-based partner identification and validation
- **AuthenticationService**: Caller authentication and authorization
- **BalanceService**: Real-time balance checking and reservation
